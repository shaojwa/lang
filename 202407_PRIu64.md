what is PRIu64 ? we should include `<inttypes.h>` when using `PRIu64`.
`PRIu64` is a format specifier, introduced iin c99. for print uint64_t, but why? `llu` cannot be enough?
because `%u`, not `%llu`, should be used on some implementation. so `%llu` is not a portable way to print uint64_t but `PRIu64`.
