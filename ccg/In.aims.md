1. The rules emphasize static type safety and resource safety. 
2. they emphasize possibilities for range checking, for avoiding dereferencing nullptr.
3. for avoiding dangling pointers, and the systematic use of exceptions (via RAII).
4. the rules also emphasize simplicity and the hiding of necessary complexity behind well-specified interfaces.
